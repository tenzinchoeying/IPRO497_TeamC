## Problem Statements

### Problem Statement #1

The current laundry system at IIT is causing a major inconvenience to residents on campus due to lack of machine availability, timeliness on removing clothing, and easily reporting maintenance issues. However, with our solution, on-campus IIT students can make reservations, check the status of the laundry machines, and get frequent notifications of their laundry cycle to maximize free time for themselves. 

### Problem Statement #2

On-campus IIT students get notified when their clothes are removed from the washer/dryer and have the ability to message other students regarding laundry to avoid losing clothing items.

## Persona 1

![Persona 1](/images/p1.png)

**Name**
-   Mike Adams

**Demographics**

-   21 years oldÂ 

-   Lives in Cunningham HallÂ 

-   Undergraduate Student Studying Computer Science at IIT

**Goal**

-   Have a working machine that's not taken to clean his clothes.

**How can we help**

-   Create a laundry app that checks the status of the laundry machines to let Mike know when they are available. If the machines are broken, have a feature that contacts the maintenance team.

**Story**

-   Mike, 21, is a Computer Science student at IIT. Mike is an on-campus resident who spends the most of his time on his phone or doing schoolwork on his laptop. When he isn't doing schoolwork, he prefers to spend his days at the gym. Mike washes his clothes frequently as a result of his physical activity. When he does go out to wash his laundry, he frequently has the problem of having to wait for one of the machines to finish because there aren't any other machines available. Other times Mike has to wait for maintenance to fix the machines because they are broken, and it can take days or weeks for the maintenance crew to respond. This irritates Mike since all he wants to do is clean his clothing, but he can't because it's either been taken or broken, and he wishes there was a mechanism in place to address the problem.

## Persona 2

![Persona 2](/images/p2.png)

**Name**
-   Sally Hanson

**Demographics**

-   19 years old

-   Lives in Kacek Hall

-   Undergraduate Student studying Chemical Engineering at IIT

-   Working part-time as a TA

**Goal**

-   Have laundry reserved for the time she needs it.

**How can we help**

-   Develop an app that allows students to reserve a specific time slot to use a laundry machine.

**Story**

-   Sally lives in Kacek Hall. From Monday to Friday, she is out of her room most of the day due to classes. She leaves her dorm around 8 AM and comes back around 5 PM. When she gets back, she goes to the dining hall for dinner and hangs out with her friends. She comes back around 8 PM and gets ready for the night. When the weekend comes around, she goes to the library on Saturday to finish her homework. Every Sunday of the week, she does Laundry at 9 PM. Sally gets very annoyed that a lot of students do their laundry on Sunday, but she canâ€™t do anything about it since thatâ€™s the only day and time that works for her from her busy schedule. She comes downstairs only to see that all the washers are full, 2 are out of order, and others are sitting with clothes, waiting for someone to pick them up. She gets frustrated and takes out clothes from a washer that has been done. She is very uncomfortable in doing this because she feels filthy from touching someone elseâ€™s undergarments, and is angry that her washer wasnâ€™t available at the exact time she does her laundry.

## Top Two to Three Scenarios

### Your Scenario #1

Mike is a very busy student, on top of his schoolwork and soccer practices, he doesn't have a lot of time to do his laundry. Mike uses the mobile app to reserve a time slot to do laundry according to his tight schedule so he can get his laundry done in his short free time. No more late laundry or occupied machines.Â 

### Your Scenario #2

Mike notices that there is a washing machine that is full of clothes and has finished its cycle. Sally received a notification 10 minutes prior, 5 minutes prior and when the cycle finished, however he wasn't able to transfer his clothes to a dryer on time because he was busy. Since Mike needed to do his laundry, Mike messages Sally via the app to inform him that his laundry is done and that he should come get his clothes. No more others touching Sally's laundry.Â 

### Your Scenario #3

Mike lives in Kacek and needs to do his laundry. He opens the app and notices that all the washing machines in Kacek are occupied, but really needs a clean pair of socks to wear tomorrow. He then uses the app to check the availability of machines in other buildings near him, and notices there is a washer open for use in Cunningham. He then brings his clothes over to Cunningham and can now have a fresh pair of socks tomorrow! ðŸ§¦
